# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Learn React Hook

# 1. useState 
in this project, used useState hook to update value of  "count" variable in multiple place and the range of count is 0-20. 

if we were using Js then we have to take every element id ref and then have to update.
but by react, variable updating in whole DOM wherever it used.
